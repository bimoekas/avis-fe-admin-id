        12.1 Website Disputes – Pre-Dispute Resolution
      </h5>
      <p className="mb-3">
        Before filing a lawsuit in connection with any Website Dispute
        (including, but not limited to, in an individual arbitration or in a
        small claims proceeding), you and Budget agree that we shall give the
        other party written notice of the claim to be asserted 30 days before
        initiating a proceeding and make a reasonable good faith effort to
        resolve the claim. If you are intending to assert a claim against
        Budget, you must send the written notice of the claim to Attention:
        Budget Rent A Car System, Inc., 6 Sylvan Way, Parsippany, New Jersey,
        07054 Attn: Legal Department. If Budget is intending to assert a claim
        against you, we will send the written notice of the claim to you at your
        address appearing in our records. NO SETTLEMENT DEMAND OR SETTLEMENT
        OFFER USED IN THIS PREDISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCESS MAY BE USED IN ANY
        PROCEEDING, INCLUDING AS EVIDENCE OR AS AN ADMISSION OF ANY LIABILITY OR
        DAMAGES (OR LACK THEREOF). After that 30-day period and not before,
        either party may elect, in writing sent to the other party, that it will
        pursue the matter either through small claims court or arbitration. The
        party receiving the notice shall then have 7 days to respond, including
        to elect for the case to be heard by a small claims court with
        jurisdiction. If either party elects small claims court, the dispute
        will be resolved in that forum and not through arbitration. Each party
        agrees that state or federal courts of New Jersey, referenced below, may
        enter injunctive relief to enforce the pre-filing requirements of this
        paragraph, including an injunction to stay an arbitration that has been
        commenced in violation of this paragraph.

        pre-dispute resolution procedure,{" "}
        <b>
          you and the Budget Parties agree to waive all rights to a jury trial
          and arbitrate all disputes and claims arising under, relating to, or
          in connection with a Website Dispute, whether in contract, warranty,
          misrepresentation, fraud, tort, intentional tort, statue, regulation,
          ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis. The interpretation
          and scope of this provision, and the arbitrability of the Website
          Dispute, are for the arbitrator to decide.
        </b>
        Neither you nor we will be able to sue in court in connection with a
        Website Dispute. All Website Disputes must be resolved through
        individual (non-class) arbitration. You and Budget waive any rights to
        maintain other available resolution processes for Website Disputes, such
        as a court action or administrative proceeding. You and Budget waive any
        right to a jury trial for Website Disputes.

      <p className="mb-3">
        You indicate your acceptance to these Terms, including this agreement to
        arbitrate, by continuing to use the Website after having the opportunity
        to review these Terms.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-3">
        The rules in arbitration are different. There's no judge or jury, and
        review is limited, but an arbitrator can award the same damages and
        relief, and must honor the same limitations stated in the agreement as a
        court would.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-3">
        The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement
        of this dispute resolution provision.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-3">
        The arbitration shall be conducted before one commercial arbitrator with
        substantial experience in resolving commercial disputes from the
        American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). As modified by these Terms,
        and unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing, the
        arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s rules for commercial
        arbitration and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the procedures
        for consumer-related disputes. For more information on AAA, its rules
        and procedures, and how to file an arbitration claim, you may call AAA
        at 800-778-7879 or visit the AAA website at{" "}

        12.3 Hearings and Decisions. If you are an individual, arbitrations will
        proceed at a location that the arbitrator selects in the county of your
        primary residence unless you and the applicable Budget Party agree
        otherwise. If you are not an individual person (but are instead, for
        instance, a partnership, corporation, or other form of entity or
        non-natural person), arbitrations shall proceed at a location that the
        arbitrator selects unless you and the applicable Budget Party agree
        otherwise.
      </h5>
      <h5 className="mb-3 text-dark">
        Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the
        arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain
        the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The
        arbitrator’s award shall be final and may be enforced in any court of
        competent jurisdiction. Further, an arbitrator’s award and any judgment
        confirming it shall apply only to that specific case and cannot be used
        in any other case except to enforce the award itself.
      </h5>
      <p className="mb-3">
        To the extent a party commences any court action that includes both
        Website Disputes and Non-Website Disputes, consideration of the
        Non-Website Disputes shall be stayed until the Website Disputes are
        fully arbitrated. Then, any Non-Website Disputes will be considered by
        any court of competent jurisdiction, unless another dispute resolution
        mechanism is applicable.
      </p>
      <h5 className="mb-3 text-dark">
        12.4 Fees and Costs. If you are an individual (instead of, for instance,
        a partnership, corporation, or other form of entity or non-natural
        person), in the event that (1) your claim is less than $10,000, and (2)
        you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be
        prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, the applicable Budget
        Parties will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection
        with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the
        arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of
        litigation. Budget also reserves the right in its sole and exclusive
        discretion to assume responsibility for all of the costs of the
        arbitration. However, the Budget Parties will not pay your share of the
        arbitration fees if the arbitrator finds that either your claim or the
        relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, as
        measured by the standards of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b).

        damages, an injunction, or other non-monetary relief—as is necessary to
        resolve any individual injury that either you or Budget have suffered or
        may suffer. In particular, if either you or a Budget Party seek
        non-monetary relief, such relief must be individualized and may not
        affect individuals or entities other than you or the applicable Budget
        Party. This requirement that claims be brought only in an individual
        capacity and not as a representative, private attorney general, or class
        member (“Class Action Waiver”) is non-severable. If the Class Action
        Waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this dispute
        resolution provision in Section 12 shall be null and void.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, the requirement that the relief sought be
        individualized and not affect individuals or entities other than you or

        such change will not apply to any dispute that you had already provided
        Budget notice of in writing.

        12.6 Severability and Survival. If any provision in this Section 12 is
        found to be unenforceable, that provision shall be severed with the
        remainder of these Terms remaining in full force and effect. The
        foregoing shall not apply to the prohibition against the Class Action
        Waiver in Section 12.5. If the Class Action Waiver is found to be
        unenforceable, this entire Section shall be null and void. The terms of
        this Section shall otherwise survive any termination of these Terms.

      <h5 className="mb-3 text-dark">
        Exclusive Venue for Other Controversies. Budget and you agree that any
        Website Dispute or Non-Website Dispute excluded from the dispute
        resolution procedure and class action waiver provisions in this Section
        (other than an individual action filed in small claims court) shall be
        filed only in the state or federal courts of New Jersey, and each party
        hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the
        exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for any such controversy.

      <h5 className="mb-3 text-dark">13.1 Severability</h5>
      <p className="mb-3">
        If any provision of these Terms shall be unlawful, void or for any
        reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from
        these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any
        remaining provisions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if the
        Class Action Waiver of these Terms is deemed unenforceable, the
        agreement of the parties to engage in arbitration shall likewise be
        deemed stricken, as further described in Section 12.8.

        Our failure to exercise any right or enforce any obligation under these
        Terms of Use or to take action with respect to a breach by you or others
        will not constitute a waiver of such right, obligation or breach. The
        waiver of any right, obligation or breach will be effective only if in
        writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Budget. In
        addition, no waiver granted in any instance shall constitute a waiver in
        any other instance.
