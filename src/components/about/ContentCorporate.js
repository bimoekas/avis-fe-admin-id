        <b>Company Overview</b>
      </p>
      <p className="mb-2">
        Avis Car Rental and its subsidiaries operate one of the world's
        best-known car rental brands with approximately 5,500 locations in more
        than 165 countries. Avis has a long history of innovation in the car
        rental industry and is one of the world's top brands for customer
        loyalty. Avis is owned by Avis Budget Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: CAR), which
        operates and licenses the brand throughout the world.{" "}

        <b>Quick History</b>
      </p>
      <p className="mb-2">
        Founded in 1946 by Warren Avis (who sold his interest in 1954), Avis was
        the first company to rent cars from airport locations. The company grew
        rapidly during the 1950's through franchised and corporate-owned
        expansion. In 1963, Avis introduced the award-winning "We try harder®"
        campaign and the tagline remains the company's rallying cry even today.
        Ten years later, Avis launched its innovative Wizard system, the
        company's proprietary reservation technology. Avis changed ownership
        multiple times in the 70's and 80's, becoming employee-owned in 1987.
        That same year, Avis introduced the Roving Rapid Return, a handheld
        computer terminal allowing customers to bypass the Avis counter. In
        1996, HFS Incorporated acquired Avis, which was then spun off as a
        separate public company, all but the franchising rights, Wizard system,
        and reservation operations. In 2000, the company introduced Avis
        Interactive, the first Internet-based reporting system for commercial
        accounts in the car rental industry, which was significantly enhanced
        and re-launched in 2006. In March 2001, Cendant Corporation purchased
        all of the outstanding shares of Avis Group Holdings and later that year
        moved its world headquarters to Parsippany, NJ. In 2006, Cendant Corp.
        separated into four independent companies: Realogy, Wyndham Worldwide,
        Travelport and Avis Budget Group, Inc., which is now the parent company
        of Avis Car Rental. In 2011, Avis Budget Group acquires Avis Europe plc.
        The transaction re-unites Avis Budget Group with its licensee for
        Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia.
