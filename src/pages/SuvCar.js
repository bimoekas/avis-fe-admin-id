SUV car rental sizes range from midsize to full-size and also include crossover SUVs, which means there are seating possibilities for 5 to 8 people, depending on the model. Make sure to consider the number of people you will be traveling with and the amount of luggage space needed before booking your reservation. Because availability at each location varies, we cannot guarantee a specific model, but weâ€™re confident you will love any SUV in the Budget fleet. Browse the SUV rental groups below to select which type of SUV you would like to rent."
